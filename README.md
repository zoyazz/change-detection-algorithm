# change-detection-algorithm
This portion of our team's project uses GIS techniques and statistical analysis to illustrate the recent intensity of forest fires across the world. Specifically, we applied change detection algorithms to forests in Australia to identify significant decreases in vegetation health.

Change Detection Algorithms
Applied to satellite imagery to detect significant decreases in vegetation health.

Resultant Maps
Magnitude of Change Map: Shows the extent of changes, with blue indicating the smallest changes and red indicating the largest changes.
Time of Change Map: Displays the timing of changes, with blue indicating older changes and red indicating more recent changes.

Results:
**The Magnitude of Change Map** highlights areas with varying degrees of vegetation health decline.
**The Year of Change Map** identifies when these changes occurred.

By comparing the magnitude and time of changes, we can assess the severity and extent of the 2020 forest fires in Australia as compared to previous fire in the area.

**Note**: the images are too large to displayed on Github. The code and images can be found here although they might take some time to run due to the complexity and size of the code. https://code.earthengine.google.com/83d297e3ff815ffb60df5813f58f2115
